Moses Mod
=========

This mod introduces the item "Staff of Moses", which can be obtained with the help of a burning bush.

With the staff equipped, right-click in the direction of water will create a passage to a dramatic music cut from "The Prince of Egypt"; right-click in any other direction or logging out will close all passages. Hitting stone with the staff will create a source of water.
One passage is maximum 5 blocks wide and 64 blocks long (it is now configurable); it may be narrower if the coastline is irregular (I might fix this someday).

As people have suggested, there is now a staff that parts both water and lava. In order to obtain one, you must throw the regular Staff of Moses into lava.

This mod should work in single player and multiplayer.

Building
--------

Link the `src` folder as source to your project build path. In order to build and package the mod fore release run the script `build.bat`. The script must be run in its current directory and the environment variable `FORGE_HOME` must point to Minecraft Forge install directory. Additionally, the mod will be packaged into an archive (with resources and mcmod.info) only if you have WinRAR installed at default path.

Hope someone provides a cleaner solution :)
